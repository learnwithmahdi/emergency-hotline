1\. What is the difference between \*\*getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll\*\*?
Answer: "getElementById" = A specific id in html. When we need to access an element dynamically by javascript, we call it by its id. "getElementsByClassName" = It selects elements by a single class or multiple classes in HTML. When we need to change them dynamically, we call them by their class. "querySelector" = It uses a css selector and finds only the first element that matches. "querySelectorAll" = It selects multiple elements using a css selector and returns them as a nodelist in javascript.
